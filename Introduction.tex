The Standard Model (SM) of particle physics  
is a mathematical description of the fundamental particles and 
their interactions.  Particles are described by quantized 
excitations of various types of fields.  Each field is a solution 
to either the Klein-Gordon, Dirac, Proca, or Maxwell equation 
which govern the time evolution of spin-0, spin-1/2, and spin-1 fields.
Although bound states and possible extensions to the SM can have
larger spin, the standard model doesn't explicitly describe the 
interactions of these particles.  

The interactions themselves are encoded in the Standard Model lagrangian.
For example, the electromagnetic interactions of electrons are described by
the lagrangian
%\begin{center}
\begin{equation}
\mathscr{L}_{EM} = \bar{\psi}\left(i\gamma^{\mu}(\partial_{\mu}+ieA_{\mu})-m\right)\psi - \frac{1}{4}F_{\mu\nu}F^{\mu\nu}.
\label{eq:EMlagrangian}
\end{equation}
%\end{center}
The probability for some initial state, i, evolving into some final state, 
j, can be be expanded in powers of the coupling constant, e, 
according to the modulus squared matrix element
%\begin{center}
\begin{equation}
\mid<ee\mid e^{\bar{\psi}\left(i\gamma^{\mu}(\partial_{\mu}+ieA_{\mu})-m\right)\psi+\frac{1}{4}F_{\mu\nu}F^{\mu\nu}}\mid ee>\mid^2.
\label{eq:matrixElementSquared}
\end{equation}
%\end{center}
Often, the amplitude of a process at some order in 
the couplings is represented by a Feynman diagram such as the one in 
figure~\ref{fig:eeScattering} representing 
ectron-electron scattering to lowest order in a purely 
electromagnetic theory.

The interactions of the SM are derived by enforcing local gauge 
symmetries and
thus can be described through a symmetry group.  For example, the 
electromagnetic interactions are known to be generated from a U(1) 
gauge symmetry.  Each symmetry has a corresponding charge which is
conserved and which the gauge mediators couple to; the photon 
couples to the electric charge, e, in the above example.  
Thus, understanding the gauge symmetries
which generate the interactions of the standard model and the 
charges of
each particle tells us how the particles interact.

Currently, the SM describes three of the four known forces, the
electromagnetic, the weak, and the strong force which are generated
from SU(3), SU(2), and U(1) gauge symmetries, respectively.  
The charges 
of the fundamental
fields known to exist in the standard model are shown in 
table~\ref{table:SMcharges}.  
The photon only couples to electrically charged
particles (Q), the W boson couples to particles charged under weak 
isospin ($T_3$), 
and the gluons couple to colored particles. As the names 
suggest, at low energies, the strong froce is the strongest
and the weak force is the weakest.  However, it is commonly believed that these interaction
should all be unified at some energy scale where the strength will become
comparable.   
%One unique consequence of this charge 
%structure is that the photon cannot couple to itself while the 
%weak vector boson and the gluons can.  The is also indicitive of
%the fact that the SU(2) and SU(3) gauge groups are non-abelian.

The idea of interactions arising from enforcing gauge symmetries, 
naively,
produces inconsistencies between theory and experiments.  Even at 
the time when the SU(2) structure of the weak interactions was first
proposed by Glashow~\cite{Glashow:1961}, the W boson was known 
to be massive.  
%One of the predictions of this guage structure, the 
%existance of a neutral weak current, was later found to also 
%be massive.  
However, mass terms in a Lagrangian break gauge
invariance.  This internal inconsistency was a major hurdle for 
a theory of the electroweak interactions since 
the SU(2) guage symmetry must be broken in a specific way in order
to allow the weak vector bosons to be massive, a process known
as electroweak symmetry breaking.  

\section{Electroweak Symmetry Breaking}
\label{sec:Electroweak Symmetry Breaking}

It was known in non-relativistic systems that spontaneously broken symmetries
could provide a theoretical framework for explaining massive gauge 
bosons\cite{Anderson:1963pc}. In the early 1960's these ideas were studied in the context
of relativistic quantum field theories.  It was shown that a complex 
scalar field whose potential was particularly chosen could spontaneously 
break a gauge symmetry and generate gauge boson masses through the 
interaction of this field with the gauge 
boson\cite{Higgs:1964,Englert:1964,Higgs:1964-2,Guralnik:1964}.  Most notably, 
Peter Higgs suggested that this would also predict the presence of a new 
massive scalar particle~\cite{Higgs:1964-2}.

It was shown by Glashow, Weinberg, and Salam~\cite{Glashow:1961,Weinberg:1967,Salam:1968} 
that the Higgs mechanism 
could be used to break a $SU(2)\times U(1)$ symmetry to a $U(1)_{em}$
symmetry producing all of the known electroweak interactions and massive 
weak gauge bosons, a model known as the Glashow-Weinberg-Salam (GWS) model.
This model predicted a massive, neutral gauge boson, the Z boson,
whose mass would be around 90 GeV which was later discovered
indirectly through electron-neutrino 
scattering~\cite{Hasert:1973,Hasert:1973-2,Hasert:1974}.  
The Z boson was later directly produced at the SpS~\cite{??}.
Another experimental signature of the GWS model was that a chargeless,
colorless, spinless, massive boson, similar to that suggested by Higgs should
exist, which is now commonly referred to as the Higgs boson.
Except for its mass all properties about this particle could be calculated
whithin the framework of the SM (see Section~\ref{sec:HiggsPhen}).  

Electroweak symmetry breaking is the cornerstone of the SM model and 
illuminating the exact mechanism is paramount to our 
understanding of the universe.  Thus, the experimental verification
of the Higgs boson and its properties has been for nearly
fifty years the top priority of the field of particle physics.   

\section{Higgs Boson Constraints}
\label{sec:The Higgs boson}

Several accelerators have been built to discover the Higgs, 
the first of which was the Large Electron-Positron (LEP) collider
which accelerated electrons and positrons to energies up to 209 GeV.
Although a broad range of Higgs masses 
were accessible to LEP experiments, no evidence was found and 
95\% CL exlusion limits were set for all masses up to 114.4~GeV~\cite{Barate:2003sz}.
Despite no evidence of the Higgs boson was 
found, the high precision measurements made on a number of SM 
quantities could be used to constrain the Higgs mass, assuming it 
were to exist according to the SM.  These constraints suggested 
that a SM Higgs would be more likely in the range $m_H\lesssim185$~GeV~\cite{Group:2008aa}.  

The Tevatron, built at Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory, 
and its experiments also contributed major efforts towards Higgs
searches.  As a 2~TeV $p\bar{p}$ collider, considerably larger 
Higgs masses were accessible.  However, no evidence of the 
Higgs boson  was found and 95\% condifence level exclusion limits
were set for Higgs boson mass between
$162<m_H<166$~GeV~\cite{Aaltonen:2010yv}.  
Despite the lack of an observation, the discovery of the
top quark and measurement of its mass helped
to refine calculations of the Higgs boson production cross section and 
branching ratios which include top loops.  

By the time the LHC was delivering beams to CMS, theory
calculations had been refined and both direct limit and indirect
limits had been set by LEP and Tevatron experiments.
Figure~\ref{fig:HiggsConstraints} summarizes the 
status of Higgs searches at this time.  Since the Higgs mechanism
must unitarize VV scattering, there is a limited mass range for 
which the Higgs mechanism makes sense, $m_H\lesssim1000$~GeV. This theoretical
upper bound and the experimental lower bound from the LEP direct
search limits suggest that the LHC would suffice to make the final
statement about the existence of the Higgs boson, nearly 50 
years after it was first proposed.

\section{Beyond the SM Higgs}

The Higgs mechanism, as described in the SM, 
via GWS, conveniently solved several problems: the existence of
massive gauge bosons, the apparent disparity between the 
electromagentic and weak forces, and the unitarity of weak boson 
scattering. Yet, despite its success at describing terrestrial 
experiments, the SM fails to explain a number of phenomena 
observed in the universe.
  
It is thought that more than 95\% of the known universe consists 
of dark matter ($\sim27$\%) and dark energy ($\sim68$\%)\cite{??}.
Since there is currently no way to explain either dark matter or 
dark energy within the SM, only about 5\% of the energy of 
the universe can be explained by the SM.  

The overabundance of matter, as opposed to anti-matter, in the 
universe, a phenomenon known as the baryon asymmetry.
It was shown by Sakharov\cite{Sakharov:1967dj} that there are 
three necessary 
conditions a model of baryogenesis must satisfy: baryon-number 
violation, charge-symmetry (C-symmetry) violation, 
charge-parity-symmetry violation (CP-violation), and interactions 
which are out of thermal equilibrium at early stages of the 
universe.  Although it has been shown that the SM does
contain the three necessary conditions for baryogenesis, it is 
believed to be insufficient for explaining the degree of baryonic 
asymmetry in the visible universe~\cite{???}.  As such, additional sources 
of CP-violation in the SM would provide a promising solution to 
the baryon-asymmetry problem.  

The expected naturalness of electroweak symmetry breaking is
also often cited as evidence for physics beyond the SM.  
Quantum corrections to the higgs mass have been found to be much 
larger than the physical Higgs mass~\cite{Aitchison:2007}. 
If it is to 
provide the 
necessary cancellations to preserve unitarity in longitudinal weak 
boson scattering, these corrections should be offset by the 
bare Higgs boson
mass in order to keep the physical mass small.  This introduces
what is known as fine tuning.  The unnaturalness of the Higgs mass
relative to the plank scale ($10^{19}$~GeV) is also known as the
hierarchy problem.

There are a 
number of proposed solutions to the fine tuning problem, some 
of which 
could also provide solutions to some of the problems noted above,
for example, Supersymmetry (SUSY).  
Since SUSY predicts that all fermions have a symmetry with a 
corresponding boson, 
all feynman diagrams which provide quantum corrections to the Higgs 
mass have a canceling partner which remove the large quantum 
corrections\footnote{Although this was not the original motivation
for SUSY, it was later suggested to provide a solution to 
fine-tuning in the SM by Witten~\cite{Witten:1981nf}, 
Veltman~\cite{Veltman:1980mj}, and Kaul~\cite{Kaul:1981wp}.  
This is discussed in more detail elsewhere~\cite{Aitchison:2007}. }.
SUSY is also thought to provide a natural dark matter candidate and
is a prerequisite for string theory, which naturally incorporates 
gravity.  Finally, it is possible 
for SUSY to allow for additional CP-violation in the Higgs sector.
Recent work has studied this idea in the more generic framework of
type-II 2 Higgs doublet models (2HDM) and found that the amount of
additional CP-violation possible in the Higgs sector could provide
a reasonable model for baryogenesis~\cite{Shu:2013uua}.  

Other explanations of fine tuning include composite Higgs models
or Randall-Sundrum models of gravity.  Composite Higgs models 
interpret the Higgs mechanism as only an effective theory and
introduce a new strongly interacting QCD-like force above the 
electroweak scale.  It was shown by Randall and 
Sundrum~\cite{Randall:1999ee} that
higher-dimensional models with warped space-time metrics can 
provide a natural explaination of the heirarchy and thus fine
tuning.

\section{Summary}

Although many of the above arguments for naturalness in the SM 
are heuristic, they suggest that the Higgs sector could be a 
window to physics beyond
the standard model through: the discovery of multiple scalars,
the discovery of CP-violation in Higgs interactions,
or the discovery of Higgs compositeness.  Today, the muon 
magnetic moment has been calculated and measured 
to an extremely high precision and has been used as a 
test of the SM as well as a probe for new physics.
Analogously, the Higgs may become the next source of high 
precision tests of the standard model which may
ultimately illuminate the existence of physics beyond the 
standard model.

\chaptermark{Higgs Phenomenology at the LHC}

In the simplest incarnation of the Higgs Mechanism, there is only one free
parameter, the Higgs Mass.  Given, the mass of the Higgs, the partial widths
for both production and decay can be calculated.  Generally, the Higgs 
couples most strongly to the most massive particles in the standard model.  
However, the mechanism for which the weak gauge bosons aquire mass and the 
fermions acquire mass is different.  Thus, the coupling of the Higgs to 
fermions is proportional to the mass of the fermion while the coupling of the 
higgs to the weak gauge bosons is proportional to the square of the gauge 
boson's mass. These features as well as the structure functions of the proton 
combine to produce the predictions show in figure~\ref{fig:HiggsProdXS} 
for the production 
cross-section and branching fraction of the Higgs.  In this chapter, the 
terminology of the different production and decay channels is introduced as 
well as the experimental signatures for each.

different processes at $\sqrt{s}=8~TeV$. right: Higgs branching
ratios vs $m_H$.  Both calculations are taking from the LHC Higgs
cross section working group. }
\end{center}
\end{figure}

The general structure of the branching ratios and production cross 
sections in different channels is one of the key features of the Higgs 
boson.  In particular,the feature that the $\gamma\gamma$ and $Z\gamma$
branching ratios are much smaller than the $ZZ$ or $WW$ is a result 
of the Higgs not coupling directly to massless particles.  Thus, these
process are required to procede through loops which would contain massive
particles, usually either top quarks or W bosons.

\section{Higgs Production}

\subsection{Gluon-gluon Fusion}
\label{sec:ggHiggs}

The gluon-gluon fusion production mechanism is responsible for $\sim 50\%$ of 
Higgs events produced at the LHC.  This is large due to the fact that the 
gluon-gluon cross section at large invariant masses is fairly large 
compared to the quark-anti-quark cross section.  
However, because the Higgs cannot couple to gluons directly, the interaction 
must be mediated through a loop, show in figure [??].  The dominant 
contributions 
come from the heavy quarks, top and bottom, which couple strongly to both
gluons and the Higgs.  The production cross section for
this process varies from $3\times10^{-2}~pb$ to $40~pb$  for Higgs masses 
between 80 and 1000 GeV and $\sqrt{s}=8~TeV$.

\subsection{Weak Vector Boson Fusion}
\label{sec:VBFHiggs}

The Weak Vector Boson Fusion (VBF) production mechanism has the next to
largest cross section at the LHC.  The fynman diagram for this process is 
shown in figure [??].  The signature of this production mechanism is two 
high energy jets at high values of pseudo-rapidity.  Because of next-to-leading
order (NLO) and next-to-NLO (NNLO) QCD effects, gluon-gluon fusion events can
also have this same signature.  As such, event classes which attempt to 
distinguish the VBF production mechanism tend to have a large contamination 
from gluon-gluon fusion.  Usually the kinematics of the spectator jets
can be used to further isolate VBF-like events. 

\subsection{Other Production Mechanisms}
\label{sec:VHiggs}

Other production mechanisms include Higgs produced in association with either
a weak gauge boson, depicted in figures [??], and top pairs, depicted in 
figure [??].  In these cases either W or Z can be tagged or the presence of 
b-jets can be included.  However, these processes only make up ~5\% of the 
total Higgs production cross section.  As such, having significant sensitivity
to these production mechanisms requires very high amount of integrated 
luminosity (of the order of 100 fb$^{-1}$). 

\section{Decay Channels}
\label{sec:HiggsDecays}

The partial decay width of the higgs, just as with productions, typically 
scale with either the mass of the decay product or the mass squared, 
depending on whether the decay is bosonic or fermionic.  As such, at low 
mass, where the production of weak gauge bosons is suppressed from 
phase-space effect, b-quarks are the dominant decay, making up $60\%$ of 
the events.  At high mass, the leading decays are to W and Z pairs.  There 
are also several decays which are mediated through loops of either quarks 
or gauge bosons.  These decays are the di-photon, di-gluon, and $Z\gamma$
channels.  Because of the distinct signature of the di-boson final states,
these channels are of the most sensitive for discoverying a Higgs-like 
resonance.  
Aside from this, the ZZ and WW decay channels are the most sensitive for 
large Higgs masses.  The ZZ and WW channels are especially promising in 
the $4\ell$ and $\ell\nu\ell'\nu'$ final states, respectively.

\section{Kinematics of scalar resonances}
\label{sec:Kinematics of scalar resonances}

The simplest incarnation of the Higgs mechanism predicts one extra scalar 
boson with the simplest coupling to the SM fields.  However, there are 
models which go beyond the minimal Higgs model and predict also other scalars
which would couple differently to the SM fields.  To generalize this, one 
can write down the most general way in which a scalar can couple to the SM
feilds.  For bosonic decays one gets the amplitude show in equation [??].  
\begin{equation}
  \mathscr{A}(X\to VV) = v^{-1}(g_1m_v^2\epsilon_1^*\epsilon_2^*+g_2f_{\mu\nu}^{*(1)}f^{*(2),\mu\nu}+g_3f^{*(1),\mu\nu}f_{\mu\alpha}^{*(2)}\frac{q_\nu q^\alpha}{\Lambda^2}+g_4f_{\mu\nu}^{*(1)}\tilde{f^{*(2),\mu\nu}}),
\end{equation}
where $f$, $\tilde{f}$ are the field strenght tensor and the conjugate field
strength tensor, $g_i$ are dimensionless couplings, $\epsilon_i$ are the 
polarization vectors of the vector bosons, $Lamba$ denotes the scale where new
physics could appear, $m_V$ is the mass of the vector boson, and q is the
momentum of the VV-system.  

This amplitude correspond to three independent
lorentz structures and can be rewritten as,
\begin{equation}
\mathscr{A}(X\to VV) = v^{-1}\epsilon_1^{*\mu}\epsilon_2^{*\nu}(a_1g_{\mu\nu}m_X^2+a_2q_\mu q_\nu+a_3\epsilon_{\mu\nu\alpha\beta}q_1^{\alpha}q_2^{\beta}). 
\end{equation}
The SM Higgs couples to the W's and Z's only through the $a_1$ term,
while it couples to the photons through an effective coupling which is a 
combination of the $a_1$ and $a_2$ terms.  A CP-odd scalar, commonly referred 
to as a pseudoscalar, couples to gauge bosons through the $a_3$ term.

The amplitude can be broken into several 
more specific amplitudes corresponding to the helicity states of the 
vector boson, where the quantization axis is taken to be ????.  For a scalar
resonance, there are only three non-zero helicity amplitudes out of the 
nine permutations,

\begin{center}
\begin{subequations}
  \begin{equation}
    A_{00} = -\frac{m_X^2}{v}(a_1\sqrt{1+x}+a_2\frac{m_1m_2}{m_X^2}x,    \end{equation}
  \begin{equation}
    A_{++} = \frac{m_X^2}{v}(a_1+ia_3\frac{m_1m_2}{m_X^2}\sqrt{x}),
    \end{equation}
  \begin{equation}
    A_{--} = \frac{m_X^2}{v}(a_1-ia_3\frac{m_1m_2}{m_X^2}\sqrt{x}),
    \end{equation}
\end{subequations}
\end{center}
where x is defined as
\begin{equation}
x=(\frac{m_X^2-m_1^2-m_2^2}{2m_1m_2})^2-1.
\end{equation}

Each helicity amplitude has a distinct angular distribution while the
magnitude of each helicity amplitude depends on the invariant masses 
of the two Z bosons and the resonance.  Together these combine into the
differential cross section according to,
\begin{equation}
master formula
\end{equation}
As a result, the differential cross section is parameterized in terms of 
the underlying couplings. 
The angular and mass distributions of these for several types of scalar 
models are shown in figure~\ref{fig:ScalarMasses} 
and~\ref{fig:ScalarHelicityAngles}.  The red and blue distributions
correspond to a SM Higgs and pseudoscalar resonances.  The green 
distributions corespond to a scalar model in which the resonance couples
to the vector boson only through the $a_2$ term.  Thus, these three models 
represent the three independent lorentz structures.  In principle,
a mixture of these terms can occur.  In fact, there is a small but 
negligible contribution from the $a_2$ exists in the SM from NLO 
electroweak corrections.  In various extensions to the SM, 2 Higgs doublet
models, multiple scalars exist with different CP properties.  It is
even possible that a CP-violating scalar resonance could exist.  The 
distributions in figures~\ref{fig:ScalarMasses} 
and~\ref{fig:ScalarHelicityAngles} clearly demonstrate that with 
enough events, the angular and mass distributions are sufficient to 
determine the couplings of an observed scalar resonance.  More over, 
it will be critical to constrain as much as possible the existance of
a CP-violating HZZ amplitude.

\end{center}
\end{figure}

The question of constraining the contribution
from either the $a_2$ or $a_3$ term of the amplitude can be more aptly 
formulated through a reparameterization of the HZZ amplitude.  The 
three complex couplings, $a_1$, $a_2$, and $a_3$ can be represented by
four real parameters, two fractions ($f_2$ and $f_3$) and two phase 
($\phi_2$ and $\phi_3$) defined as
\begin{center}
\begin{subequations}
  \begin{equation}
    f_i = \frac{|a_i|^2\sigma_i }{|a_1|^2\sigma_1+|a_2|^2\sigma_2+|a_3|\sigma}
    \end{equation}
  \begin{equation}
    \phi_i = arg(\frac{g_i}{g_1}).
    \end{equation}
\end{subequations}
\end{center}
We note that $\sigma_i$ is the cross section of the process corresponding
to $g_i=1$ and $g_{\neq i}=0$.  The fractions represent an effective yield 
resulting from the corresponding term of the amplitude.  In the case where
there is no interference, this interpretation is exact.  These variables
are also straight forward measurables for experiments, as will be discussed
in later sections.  

Similar calculations can been made for a generic spin-1 or spin-2 
resonance~\cite{??}.  
Figures~\ref{fig:VectorMasses},~\ref{fig:VectorProdAngles}, 
and~\ref{fig:VectorHelicityAngles} show two choice vector 
resonance models.  
Figures~\ref{fig:TensorMasses},~\ref{fig:TensorProdAngles}, 
and~\ref{fit:TensorHelicityAngles}
show three choice tensor 
resonance models.  Similar to the case of a scalar resonance, sufficient
information is contained in the angular and mass distributions to 
constrain all the parameters of the vector-vector-vector amplitude. 
Although an exhaustive study of all the spin-2 couplings hasn't been 
performed... the situation is roughly the same.

\subsection{Variables for Property Measurements}
\label{sec:Spin-parity}

Understanding the spin and CP of any new resonace discovered at the LHC
will be critical to understanding its role in nature.  Since measuring 
model parameters requires a description of all backgrounds, acceptance
effects, and resolution in 8 dimensions, a more efficient way of
constraining resonance properties is to use compact variables which are
close to optimal.  Such a variable can be built from either the 
square of the matrix element for two processes, or equivalently, the
differential cross section, according to
\begin{equation}
D_{J^P} = \frac{\mathscr{P}_{SMH}}{\mathscr{P}_{SMH}+\mathscr{P}_{J^{P}}}.
\label{eq:KD}
\end{equation}
These type of variable uses the ideal distributions to isolate emphasise
kinematic difference between two choice models.  In principle, it is not
an optimal discriminant since it does not include information of the 
detector level distributions.  However, because acceptance effects are 
multiplicative, they will cancel in the ratio of the two probabilities.
Other detector effects which are not multiplicative, such as resolution
effects, will not cancel in these ratios.  However, in channels with 
good angular and energy resolution, these effects will be small; moreover,
this only effects the optimality of such a discriminant.

These variables can either be used either to perform hypothesis separation
or for measuring some continuous model parameters, as will be demonstrated 
later.  To perform such measurements an accurate description of the detector 
level distribution of D must be modeled.  Simulated Monte Carlo (MC)
events can be used, including all detector simulations, reconstruction
algorithms, and analysis selections, to model the shape of these discriminants.
Thus, MC simulations can effectively be used to model the appropriate 
transfer function for a given analysis.  From here, D can be used either 
as an additional selection variable, or for fitting the shape of data. 

Similar variables can be constructed to help discriminate signal effects 
from SM background events,
\begin{equation}
D_{bkg} = \frac{\mathscr{P}_{sig}}{\mathscr{P}_{sig}+\mathscr{P}_{bkg}}.
\end{equation}
Typically, invariant mass distributions are used in resonances searches. 
As will be shown in chapter~\ref{sec:HZZsearches}, variables similar to 
$D_{bkg}$ have proven to provide a significant increase in sensitivity to 
Higgs-like events if used in conjunction with the relevant invariant
mass distributions.  It should be noted, that these variables are important
for properties as well; understanding properties of signal events first
requires good sensitivity to signal and background events.  

\begin{figure}
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=.49\linewidth]{HiggsPhenPlots/D0minusComparison.pdf}
\label{fig:fa3Comparison}
\caption{Distributions of $D_{0-}$ for }
\end{center}
\end{figure}

Certain discriminants have properties which allow them to be efficiently
used to measure model parameters.  Consider the situation in which prior
knowledge allows us to know that a resonance is a scalar in which $f_2=0$.
In this case, $f_3$ can be measured directly using kinematic discriminants,
specifically, $D_{0-}$.  Figure~\ref{fig:fa3comparison} shows this discriminant for
both the SM Higgs (red??), a pseudoscalar (blue??), and a mixed parity 
model corresponding to $f_3=0.5$, $\phi_3=0.0$ (green??), $\pi/2$ (purple??),
$\pi$ (brown??), $3\pi/2$ (magenta??).  All of the mixed parity samples
can be described by a weighted sum of the SM Higgs distribution and the 
pseudoscalar distibution, 
\begin{equation}
\mathscr{P}(D_{0-}|f_3) = |\mathscr{A}_{SMH}|^2 + |\mathscr{A}_{0-}|^2 + 2Re(\mathscr{A}_{SMH}^*\mathscr{A}_{0-}) \simeq (1-f_3)\mathscr{P}_{SMH}(D_{0-})+f_3\mathscr{P}_{0-}.
\label{eq:fa3}
\end{equation}
$P_{SMH}$ and $P_{0-}$ represent the different cross section of the 
SM Higgs model and the pseudoscalar, respectively, 
\begin{equation}
\mathscr{P}_{J^P}(D_{0-}) = \frac{d\Gamma}{dD_{0-}} \sim \int |\mathscr{A}_{J^P}|^2d\Omega.
\end{equation}
Thus, using equation~\ref{eq:fa3} the interference is explicitly neglected.  
Thus, we can gather from figure~\ref{fig:fa3Comparison} that $D_{0-}$ is insensitive to
the interference and the relative phase between $\mathscr{A}_{SMH}$ and
$\mathscr{A}_{0-}$.  A more explicit justification of this procedure can be
realized by drawing toys from the simulation of the full matrix element and
fitting for $f_3$ with equation~\ref{eq:fa3}.  Figure~\ref{fig:???} shows
the result of fitting $f_3$ for several mixed parity models, corresponding 
$f_3=.05,.1,.5$; no bias is found in any of these toys studies.

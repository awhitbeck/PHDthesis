\begin{abstract}
Understanding the exact nature of electroweak symmetry breaking,
for which the Higgs is thought to be a direct product of, 
is one of the primary goals of the LHC.  Although the Standard
Model (SM) of electroweak interactions has been extremely successful
in describing a number of phenomena, there are still questions 
to be address pertaining to its naturalness and its possible 
connection to beyond the SM physics.  This thesis will
develop the foundation of a new set of tools which 
have not only been used to search for new resonances but to
characterize the newly discovered 125~GeV resonance at the LHC.
Two searches for Higgs resonances decaying to a pair of Z 
bosons which exploit these tools using the Compact Muon Solenoid
are presented.
Prospects for using these new analysis techniques in other Higgs
channels and at future colliders is addressed.  Finally, results
are interpretted in the context of possible extensions to the SM
and their effect on our understanding of the universe.

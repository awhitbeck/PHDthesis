\begin{abstract}
The Standard Model (SM) has accurately predicted many experimental
results over the last several decades; yet, there are still many 
unexplained phenomenon.  .. blah .. the exact nature of dark 
energy/matter, the cause 
of the matter/anti-matter asymmetry, and the cause of electroweak 
symmetry breaking. The Higgs mechanism is the simplest theoretical model 
for explaining electroweak symmetry breaking and produces the Higgs boson, 
which has gone undetected for several decades.  In this thesis I will
describe several searches for the Higgs boson at the Compact Muon 
Solenoid (CMS).  I will discuss the role of these analyses in the 
discovery of a 126 GeV resonance.  I will discuss phenomenological 
aspect of Higgs properties and measurements done to constrain the 
properties of the 126 GeV resonance.
